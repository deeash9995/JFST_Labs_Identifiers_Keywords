:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Java Identifiers and Keywords::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


-->Keywords
Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in Java programming that have special meanings to the compiler.


As declared in the code,
int studentId;


'int' is a key word. The compiler will understand that the variable 'id' is of integer type.


Try:
1. try creating a variable 'studentName' that holds the student's name.
2. try creating a variable 'dateOfBirth' to store the date of birth of the student. 
3. try creating a variable 'nationality' to store the nationality of the student. 
4. try displaying the values.



-->Identifiers
Identifiers are the name given to variables, classes, methods, etc.


Try:
1. try creating a variable 'goto' of any type that holds any value of the selected type and see
   if it gets compiled or not.
